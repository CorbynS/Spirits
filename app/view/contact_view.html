		The Ghost Council is selected at the end of every fall semester. They serve a one year term, which
		begins the following spring. Even though the duties of our officers have changed over the years, we
		have kept the original names of the offices. For example, Royal Spirit Haunt is in charge of drag
		paint, Special Projects Haunts are our social officers, and Singing Haunt is in charge of designing
		t-shirts.
